  <p>There are some feelings in life that are too deep for words, but I will try, because you deserve to know the truth of what’s in my heart.
    
    I love you. Not just in the way that people say "I love you" casually, but in a way that feels sacred — in a way that lives in my chest like a heartbeat I never want to lose. Being with you feels like coming home after a long journey. It’s warmth, it’s peace, it’s something I don’t need to explain to myself — I just feel it.
    
    Sometimes, when I look at you, I see someone I’ve already loved before this life. You remind me so much of my grandmother — may she rest in peace. She was the first woman I truly loved. Her voice calmed storms inside me, her embrace made me feel safe from the world, and her kindness left a permanent mark on my soul. You carry that same light. That same purity. That same strength wrapped in gentleness.
    
    With you, Nour, I feel protected and understood in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s like God sent me a piece of her love in you — a second chance to hold on to what I lost. That’s why I treasure you so much. That’s why I can’t stop myself from holding your hand longer than I should, or kissing your forehead like it's something holy.
    
    And today, I’m so happy. June 23, 2025 — one month with you. One beautiful, unforgettable month. Just saying that makes me smile. I’m proud of us, of this little beginning we’ve built. I know it’s only the start, but I want forever with you.
    
    You are not just my girlfriend. You are a soul I’ve known before, a heart that brings me comfort in this life, just like hers did. And because of that, I promise I will love you with the kind of love that never fades. I will cherish you the way I wish I had more time to cherish her.
